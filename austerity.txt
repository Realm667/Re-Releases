Description             : A little map-set inspired by AgentSpork's masterpiece 
			  and megawad project "Simplicity"

Thx goes to	        : id Software for DooM & Quake
			  Randy Heit for ZDoom
			  Graf Zahl for GZDoom
			  AgentSpork for Simplicity (also for some Textures & GFXs)
			  Pascal Van Heiden for Doom Builder
			  Nick "Nightmare" Baker for his texture sets
			  Wadfather and its contributors for the skybox
			  The ZDoom community for technical support
			  Epic Megagames "OMF 2097" and "Epic Pinball" for music
			  Björn "Vader" Ostmann, "The NUtcracker", "none", 
			   "Solarsnowfall" and "Cutmanmike" for Beta Testing

Hints & Darkness	: If the maps look by far too dark in GZDoom's OpenGL mode,
			  change your sector light mode (GL Settings) to something
			  else, for example "Standard", "Bright" or "Legacy" instead
			  of "Doom" and it should look better!
