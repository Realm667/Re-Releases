                          Knee-Deep in ZDoom

Description             : One evening, just about 2 months ago, I had this idea of
                          creating just one ZDoom map together with some other mappers
                          and friends. Well, who else could be mor qualified as the
                          ZDoom.org community itself? :) That was the day, when I opened
                          a new thread over at the ZDoom forums and telling those
                          people my plans, and the rest is just history which can be
                          read over at: 
                            http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=2935
                          By the way, this is the longest thread ever in the history
                          of Forums@ZDoom.org with over 1000 replies (no spam) and over
                          10.000 views, amazing, isn't it? :)
                          Thx goes to all the contributors, they really worked hard
                          and also very fast, so this could be released within one
                          month of developement!
                          
                          This is an updated version that takes advantage of ZDoom 2.1.1's
                          custom weapon support and replaces the DEHSUPP-based weapons that
                          restricted the first version to ZDoom 2.0.63a only.
                          It also features some gameplay enhancements in a few critical
                          areas.
                          
                          2.1 fixes the missing thunder sound that was accidentally omitted
                          from 2.0.

Technical Info          : Some parts of the map might slow down your system, for example
                          the "Outdoor Pump Area" or the large "Containment Area", beware
                          of exploding RAM components and burning processors ;)

Map Data                : Vertices        = 24047
(we are proud for)        Linedefs        = 29395
                          Sidedefs        = 48586
                          Sectors         = 04524
                          Things          = 02078
