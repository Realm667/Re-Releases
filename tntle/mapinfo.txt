"You hear the crying sound of the
dying evil which was lying behind the
black void in the centre of the dark
portal.

Suddenly the exploding portal brightens
up and a heavy maelstrom pulls you into
the moribund emptiness... you feel that
slowly your soul is freed from its mortal
host and you know the war is finally
over but you lost this fight...

A true hero is the one whose exploits 
no one will ever discover! -Outer Limits"
