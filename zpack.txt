*Map information*

Note: this list does not include descriptions for every map in the .pk3! 
It is supposed to be bonus-material, giving the authors a chance to make 
some personal comments on their work if they felt like doing it.

--------------

Map         : Blast
Author      : Phobus
Lump        : E1M2
Build Time  : A few evenings
Idea Base   : ZDCMP2
Description : Small map I put together just to prove I could still detail, and also so I could make a minor representation of all the hard work that went into the ill-fated ZDCMP2. Probably one of the maps I'm most proud of making, despite its small size.

---------------

Map         : Foregone Destruction
Author      : Tormentor667
Lump        : E2M0
Build Time  : About a month
Idea Base   : The original map is part of Doomworld's Community Chest 3 and was included by Salahmander's proposal to remove E2M0 for quality reasons
Description : The map was meant to be a classic Doom 2 vanilla map for the later tier, mostly brown - as usual for Tormentor667's mapping style in the early 2000's.

---------------

Map         : Switchback (A 3-in-1 Remake)
Author      : Phobus
Lump        : E2M1
Build Time  : A week or so, plus a few hours for touching up
Idea Base   : The first three maps of my wad Scourge, backwards.
Description : Fight your way through a reverse of Mr D. Guy's journey... and make it a lot further than he did. You'll also discover why his house got invaded in the first place!

---------------

Map         : Sector
Author      : Xaser
Lump        : E3M0
Build Time  : Two days. That is, if by 'days' you mean 'long-drawn-out-months'.
Idea Base   : Mind of mine.
Description : Appearances *will* be deceiving. Watch and be amazed as the map transforms before your very eyes. Insanity? Yes please.
Credit goes to Zero Prophet for adding one hell of a secret to the map. I dare you all to find it. It's worth it. 

---------------

Map         : The Spirit Underworld
Author      : hnsolo77
Lump        : E3M5 
Build Time  : 2.5 months and 1.5 bottles of whisky.
Idea Base   : Doom II's MAP28.
Description : the result of me drinking heavily while coming up with a map idea, essentially think The Spirit world, now think about it on steroids, then think about it on even more steroids, wash rinse and repeat as necessary.

---------------

Map         : Uac Waste and Storage Facility
Author      : hnsolo77
Lump        : E1M4
Build Time  : honestly i don't remember, i built this quite a while ago.
Idea Base   : MAP04 of Doom II since it was for a failed remake project.
Description : an enhanced version of The Focus, not much more to say really...

----------------

Map         : Ultimate Insanity
Author      : InsanityBringer
Lump        : E2M2
Size        : Medium
Difficulty  : Easy-Medium
Build Time  : A bunch of months
Idea Base   : Nothing. OK, so ZDCMP1 inspired me some
Description : My first map release ever. Easyish map with a medium length. Some details
Author Quote: "I'm tired of this map. Lets just get every bug fixed so I can be done with it."

----------------

Map         : Fanboy
Author      : farlowj
Lump        : E2M5
Build Time  : A lot longer than it should have been, maybe 3 months?
Idea Base   : An idea I had for a while but finally got around to making
Description : An experiment in messing around with gravity and trying to make scripted fans that look realistic. Seems to have turned out alright, though it takes a little getting used to on the timing of your jumps. 

----------------

Map         : Blackrock
Author      : Vader
Lump        : E3M7
Build Time  : 3 or 4 month
Idea Base   : A map that was supposed to be done for CC3, but I never got around finishing it!
Description : A huge, very non-linear map with quite some monsters to face. I think this is my best work up to date!
Thanks goes to Esselfortium, Belial and Huy Pham for playtesting and help improving this map!

----------------

Map         : Thunderpeak Powerplant
Author      : Vader
Lump        : E1M8
Build Time  : about 5 month
Idea Base   : Nothing I guess
Description : Basically I just wanted to create a map that features a thunderstorm, so I made one... I also tried some "new" ways of using additive translucent textures, resulting in those fancy electricity thingys and glows around some of the wall lights :P
 
----------------

Map         : Termination
Author      : Vader
Lump        : E1M9
Build Time  : 2 or 3 month
Idea Base   : Thunderpeak Powerplant :P
Description : The whole map was first designed to be the end of Thunderpeak, but it ended up being much too large, so I had to make it its own map.
Be prepared for a surprise in this map!
Thanks goes to Hnsolo77 and Judge, for providing music for this map. 

----------------

Map         : Colossus Reloaded
Author      : Vader
Lump        : E1M0
Build Time  : 1 week
Idea Base   : map06 (Colossus) from Rebirth
Description : We were in the need of an additional secret map, so I thought what could be done in a short amount of time. I ended up with this map and although it's nothing spectacular, I think it worked out quite ok...

A general note on the par times in my maps:
I did a speedrun of each map, trying to complete it as fast as possible on UV! Extreme map-knowledge, including some secrets may be necessary to beat those times!

----------------

Map : More Tricks & Traps
Author : Tormentor667
Lump : E2M3
Build Time : About one month
Description : My inspiration came from the original Tricks & Traps of Doom2, so the main goal for this one was to create a map with lots of traps and places where the player has to react as fast as possible but not always in an intuitive manor.

----------------

Map : Abyss to the BBQ
Author : Tormentor667
Lump : E2M9
Build Time : 2-3 weeks
Description : Episode 2 was in the desperate need of a fitting boss battle map so I started this. I played around with different ACS actions to get a experience that keeps you on your toes during the battle, kinda reminds me of Unreal.

----------------

Map : Black Inferno
Author : Tormentor667
Lump : E2M7
Build Time : 2 Months
Description : This was my first ZPack contribution and I actually had no idea what and how to start so I simply began with mapping. The longer I worked on it, the more this started to look like a hybrid of Torment & Torture and some urban city Doom 2 map.

----------------

Map : Nuclear Sky
Author : Tormentor667
Lump : E1M7
Build Time : 3 lazy months
Description : Based on an unfinished map from Nick Baker (Nightmare), I started to complete this map and gave it my own style and look. It's mostly a UAC facility placed in a canyon. It's very linear and even has a "The Waste Tunnels" tribute area, can you find it? :p

----------------

Map : KDiZD Launch Site
Author : Tormentor667 & Vader
Lump : E1M3
Build Time : Hard to tell
Description : A collaborate effort from Björn "Vader" Ostmann and me, some KDiZD inspired uac installation where you only have a certain amount of time to stop a missile from being fired (depending on the skill setting). It's a different approach on gameplay so I'd suggest playing that! 
Vader adds: Actually, the main work on this map was done by Torm, since I'm a lazy ass sometimes :P
Basically my contribution to this map have just been some rooms I made for another map of mine (UAC City on WadsInProgress) I never had the motivation to finish... good to see these areas put to use finally.

----------------

Map : Vestibule
Author : Captain Toenail
Lump : E1M1
Build Time : a lot of hours, on and off
Description : ZPack needed a definate map01, and this is it, it's short and sweet as they should be and was originally going to be a remake of Final Doom map01.

----------------

Map : SiteX
Author : Captain Toenail
Lump : E1M5
Build Time : a few hours,
Description : A nice short blast-fest taking place in some sort of archeological dig, but watch out, something powerful was released from it's stone prison here, and there are corrupt marines too! Good luck!

----------------

Map : Terror Cube
Author : Zippy
Lump : E2M6
Build Time : 8 months or so real time, plenty of on and off mapping.
Description : The initial basic idea was to make a "Doom style" map with fairly transparent ZDoom upgrades. To clarify, a lot of maps today depart significantly from the style and feeling of classic Doom maps, so this was to be a "find red key to open red w/ simple puzzles" map making basic use of ZDoom's features (for example, the early raising stairs puzzle is very Doomy simple, but not possible in vanilla Doom). The titular Terror Cube "device" was put in to allow me to plausibly vary the theme throughout the map (not that plausibility is needed with Doom nowadays). I originally planned 4 sections, but time and design constraints forced me to drop the "Marble Palace" section. In my goals for a "Doom style" map, I felt I largely succeeded.

------------------

Map : The 13th Hour
Author : Zippy
Lump : E3M6
Build Time : 3 weeks
Description : Designed from the start to be a small combat map (and thus be quick to develop. I'm a horribly slow mapper when it comes to architecture). The initial setup with the Mancubi and Arachnotrons was purposely meant to mirror Doom 2's Dead Simple for two reasons: to pay tribute to that map, and because any veteran player should recognize the setup and immediately understand what the objective of the map is. I decided I wanted to expand the map with more "rounds" early, so I developed the clock motif to fit that purpose and add a little bit of flair to the map. The name sprang almost naturally from that. Some credit to a friend of mine who helped put the clock graphic together.
