"As you watch back over your shoulder,
you can still see the dark silhouettes
of the blasted facilities. You are happy
that you are still alive, because you know
that none of your comrades could
have made it through this tremendous
building.

Finally a ear-battering noise takes
your attention back to what lies in
front of you, an evil blasted fortress
with the last hell portal on earth.

Soon the reign of terror will be over..."

"An unpleasant stench lingered in the air
as the last of these demonic spiders
fell to the ground. The portal guards
failed their challenge as your last
bullet pierced their lifeless bodyies.
The last thing to do now was to destroy
the final gate on earth to prevent
new demons from hell to haunt your 
homeworld.
As you stood in front of the portal, 
recharging your rocket launcher, you
hesitated for one short moment... you
couldn't destroy the gate, something
was pulling you into this black void...
maybe just curiosity, maybe a superhuman 
power... you couldn't stand it any longer
and followed the nothingness... your 
mission seemed to be a failure..."
