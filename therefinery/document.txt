CLOUD
-----
The first argument sets the radius of the circle the clouds spawn in.
If ARGS[0] is left as 0, the spawner defaults to a 96 radius circle.

SPARKS
------
Use the first three arguments to control the frenquency and direction the particles are
spawned.

First argument controls the direction. 0 is up, 1 is down, 2 is forward. Down-facing
spawners should be placed 8 map units below the ceiling.

The second argument controls the frequency of the spawner. Values are divided by 16,
so you can't get a spawner that spawns every time. This argument is only used if the
third argument is 0.

The third argument prevents it from activating spontaneously, and can only be activated
by the ACS function Thing_Activate. 0 will let it spawn automatically (using the second
argument for frequency), and 1 makes it ACS-only.


RATS
----
Place the rat spawner in your map, and use values set on the specials tab to modify it.
The first argument sets the number of rats to spawn. This ranges from 1 to 5.
The second argument sets the radius to spawn rats from the centre of the spawner.

TRITE
-----
The Web state is activated through the ACS fuction SetActorState
and is used to lower the Trite to the floor as though it was on a web.
(Note that this only really helps if it's spawned above the floor.)
