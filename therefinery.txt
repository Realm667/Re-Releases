Description             : A reinterpretation or remake of Doom's original
			  E2M3, heavily inspired by KDiZD and the vision for
			  TSoZD with a little personal twist. The whole map
			  has been enlarged, restructured, new areas have
			  been added, old ones enhanced and the whole thing
			  has been turned into something more real and creepy.
			  Expect something totally different in a place that
			  you already know to a very good extend.

			  On top of that, the map has three phases, which can
			  be played in a sequence. Phase 1 has less monsters
			  but also less equipment, so play it carefully. Phase 2
			  is arcade-action oriented with lots of gunfodder. 
			  Phase 3 is a surprise and totally different from the
			  other two phases.
