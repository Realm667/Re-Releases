Description             : A reinterpretation or remake of Doom's original
			  E2M3, heavily inspired by KDiZD and the vision for
			  TSoZD with a little personal twist. The whole map
			  has been enlarged, restructured, new areas have
			  been added, old ones enhanced and the whole thing
			  has been turned into something more real and creepy.
			  Expect something totally different in a place that
			  you already know to a very good extend.

			  On top of that, the map has three phases, which can
			  be played in a sequence. 

			  - Phase 1 has less monsters but also less equipment, 
			    so play it carefully and try to discover the map.
			  - Phase 2  is arcade-action oriented with lots of gunfodder,
			    it comes close to the casual Doom experience. 
			  - Phase 3 is totally different from the other two phases.
			    The map route has been completely revamped, the structures
			    are changing organically (literally) and a time-limit
			    mechanic has been added as well.
