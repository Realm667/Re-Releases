Description             : A reinterpretation or remake of Doom's original
			  E2M3, heavily inspired by KDiZD. The whole map
			  has been enlarged, restructured, new areas have
			  been added, old ones enhanced and the whole thing
			  has been turned into something more real and creepy.
			  Expect something totally different in a place that
			  you already know to a very good extend.
