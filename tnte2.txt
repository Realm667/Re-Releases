Description             : Amazing, almost one year after my victory in the 
			  NewDoom WIAW (Wad In A Week) Contest, the Torment
			  & Torture Series goes round 2 :) Outstanding effects,
			  unbelievable scenery and a lot of guts and bones keep
			  your fingers chili hot :P
Additional Info		: This is so far the largest (Z)DooM Map I have ever created
			  and though it is full of detail, different styles and
			  surprising events :)
Story			: When you left the dungeons of torment (Episode 1) you
			  thought, your fight is over. But a huge and insuperable
			  mountainside braved your escape. On its top seem to be
			  some abandoned mines or sth. like that. Unfortunately it
			  seems to be the only way out of the blasted evil fortress
			  behind you...
Technical Important Info: The map itself is very dark so I recommend, you change
			  the brightness and kontrast of your monitor to the maximum
			  for best gameplay :)
			  Also, because of the high detail of the map, zdoom could
			  crash because of a "Z_Malloc" error or something like this.
			  If you encounter such a warning, start the map with the 
			  command line parameter "-heapsize 16" (32, 64 or more as far
			  as this doesn't work!
New Monster Info	: In TNT2, there are two new monsters you have to deal with.
			  Her you will get a few informations on them:
			  "Combat Chaingunner" look almost exactly like their sequel
			  but they have a titanium armor and take three times more
			  damage than the weaker chaingunner.
			  "Infested Marines" are like all the other zombies except
			  they didn't lost their vital and physical abilites as the
			  Zombieman did. They are twice as fast as an Zombieman and
			  have also a higher firerate. Be careful, they take a lot
			  of bullets before they go down!
Thx goes to	        : Derek "Afterglow" Mac Donald for the Q1TEX.WAD
			  Enjay, BigBadGangsta, Tarin & Ichor for technical support 
			  @ Doomworld.com's Editing forums :)
			  Epidermis Emporium for 2 Skins I use (sorry, don't know the
			  author's name anymore)
			  FrancoisX Delmotte for the Ogro Texture Pack
			  id Software for DooM, DooM2 BUT DooM3 (I hate about
			  that high performance sucking shit >:| Keep the old
			  dooming style forever!)
Special Thx goes to	: Biffy for fixing a lot in the first(second buggy wad 			  
			  (music, unclosed sectors, 0 length lines, "unpegged" 
			  misalignment and much more) and for making it absolutely 
			  perfect! :) Thx dude!
