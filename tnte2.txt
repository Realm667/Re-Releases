Description             : Remarkably, nearly a year following my triumph in the NewDoom WIAW 
			  (Wad In A Week) Contest, the Torment & Torture Series enters its 
			  second round. This installment boasts extraordinary effects, incredible 
			  scenery, and an abundance of intense action, ensuring that your fingers 
			  remain thrillingly engaged.

Additional Info		: This is the largest (Z)DooM map I have ever created to date. Despite its 
			  size, it is filled with intricate details, a variety of styles, and a 
			  number of surprising events.

Story			: After leaving the dungeons of torment (Episode 1), you thought your fight 
			  was over. However, a massive and insurmountable mountainside blocked your 
			  escape. At its peak, there appear to be some abandoned mines or something 
		 	  similar. Unfortunately, it seems to be the only way out of the blasted evil 
			  fortress behind you...

Technical Important Info: The map is quite dark, so I recommend adjusting the brightness and contrast 
			  of your monitor to the maximum for optimal gameplay. Additionally, due to the 
			  high level of detail in the map, ZDooM might crash due to a 'Z_Malloc' error 
			  or something similar. If you encounter such an error, try starting the map 
			  with the command line parameter '-heapsize 16' (or 32, 64, or more if necessary 
			  until it works)

New Monster Info	: In TNT2, you will encounter two new monsters. Here is some information 
			  about them:

    			  Combat Chaingunner: These enemies look almost identical to their predecessors, 
			  but they are equipped with titanium armor and can withstand three times more 
			  damage than the weaker chaingunners.

    			  Infested Marines: Similar to other zombie types, but these have not lost 
			  their vital and physical abilities like the Zombiemen did. They are twice 
			  as fast as a Zombieman and also have a higher rate of fire. Be cautious, 
			  as they require a significant amount of bullets to take down!"

Thx goes to	        : Derek "Afterglow" Mac Donald for the Q1TEX.WAD
			  Enjay, BigBadGangsta, Tarin & Ichor for technical support @ Doomworld.com's Editing forums :)
			  Epidermis Emporium for 2 Skins I use (sorry, don't know the author's name anymore)
			  FrancoisX Delmotte for the Ogro Texture Pack
			  Perkristian for the hires Doom sound replacements
			  id Software for DooM, DooM2 BUT DooM3 (I hate about that high performance 
			   sucking shit >:| Keep the old dooming style forever!)

Special Thx goes to	: Biffy for fixing a lot in the first(second buggy wad 			  
			  (music, unclosed sectors, 0 length lines, "unpegged" 
			  misalignment and much more) and for making it absolutely 
			  perfect! :) Thx dude!
