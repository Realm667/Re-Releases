Description             : Remarkably, nearly a year following my triumph in the NewDoom WIAW 
			  (Wad In A Week) Contest, the Torment & Torture Series enters its 
			  second round. This installment boasts extraordinary effects, incredible 
			  scenery, and an abundance of intense action, ensuring that your fingers 
			  remain thrillingly engaged.

Additional Info		: This is the largest Doom map I have ever created to date. Despite its 
			  size, it is filled with intricate details, a variety of styles, and a 
			  number of surprising events.

Story			: After leaving the Dungeons of Torment (Episode 1), you thought your fight 
			  was over. However, a massive and insurmountable mountainside blocked your 
			  escape. At its peak, there appear to be some abandoned mines or something 
		 	  similar. Unfortunately, it seems to be the only way out of the blasted evil 
			  fortress behind you...

New Monster Info	: In TNT2, you will encounter two new monsters. Here is some information 
			  about them:

    			  Heavier Heavy Weapon Dude: a formidable adversary in this narrative,  
			  bears a striking resemblance to its predecessors, yet it stands apart  
			  in its remarkable resilience. Outfitted with titanium armor, this enemy  
			  is a force to be reckoned with, capable of enduring three times the damage  
			  that its less formidable chaingunner counterparts can withstand. This  
			  enhanced durability makes the Combat Chaingunner a daunting challenge,  
			  requiring strategy, skill, and determination to overcome.

    			  Infested Marines: present a unique and perilous challenge in this narrative.  
			  Resembling other zombie types in appearance, these adversaries retain their  
			  vital and physical abilities, unlike their Zombiemen counterparts. These  
			  marines are a force to be reckoned with, possessing agility and speed that  
			  is twice that of a Zombieman, coupled with a higher rate of fire. Their  
			  formidable combat skills demand caution and strategy from any challenger,  
			  as they require a significant amount of firepower to defeat. Engaging with  
			  these relentless foes is a true test of endurance and skill in this thrilling saga.
