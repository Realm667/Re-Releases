Description             : The experience of playing through Knee-Deep in
                          the Dead is one that many gamers will never
                          forget, but through the years the episode has
                          become too easy for many to play through and
                          enjoy the way they did the first time.

                          Knee-Deep in ZDoom is an interpretation of Id
                          Software's original groundbreaking production,
                          Knee-Deep in the Dead. The team has focused on
                          expanding the original episode by utilizing the
                          power of Randy Heit's ZDoom port; adding new
                          areas, features, and gameplay devices not
                          possible under the original Doom engine.
                          Knee-Deep in ZDoom is a new experience, but holds
                          strong to the atmosphere of the original. Relive
                          the fear. Relive the nightmare. Relive Phobos.
