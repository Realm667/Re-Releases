Notes of things to do in PK3:

Following textures in textures/ are redundant. Simplify to one texture using TEXTURES lump.
	pipeh.png
	pipesh1.png
	pipesh2.png
Also some redundancy:
	n_warn??.png

Split up decorate.txt file more.

Make sure all monsters call A_GiveToTarget("CoinItem", 5) at the very beginning of their Death/XDeath
states, so that way the reward is immediate (especially for when time is frozen).
--DONE--

NightmareDemon is broken. Where's ACS script 200 and 201? (Now in sthldcmn.acs, incomplete)
REALLY IMPORTANT: Make sure all deadlines are ACS_Execute(255,0,0), monster activated,
and _repeatable action_ !
STR14 needs more ammo.

Fix the font: 5 and 6, comma and period look too similar.

Make use of language lump for possible future translations.
