"As you leave, you take one last look
at the blasted city which lies behind
you: The streets are covered with blood,
guts and bones of your enemies, the rotten
stench of burning flesh still is in the wind
and your gun's barrel hasn't yet stopped
glowing.
After your recovery, the combat against
hell will continue, and you know that
the evil demons still need someone who
kicks their asses... maybe in a new 
adventure by Tormentor667 :) ... soon!"
