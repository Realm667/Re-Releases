	"\n\n"
	"The body wants to draw its seams together."
	"\n\n"
	"But Jesus hangs before the convert eternally wounded, eternally weeping from his gashes."
	"\n\n"
	"How to open hers without nails or thorns? How to measure heartbeats without seeing blood heave out its rhythms?"
	"\n\n"
	"A gush slows under pressure even as the pulse goes on. Our lesions take air, our infections seek sunlight. How to resist our unwilled mechanisms to staunch?"
	"\n\n"
	"We push through the same tear in the world and leave it sore."
	"\n\n"
	"When we come, we come open."
	"\n\n"
	"Pick a wound slow to bleed and slower to seal. We cream the scar to fade our atlas of living—what itched its way to a silver road, what shadow constellation of pox. The convert counts Jesus' wounds."
