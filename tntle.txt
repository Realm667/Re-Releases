Description             : This episode of TNT has three distinct objectives. Firstly, it 
			  serves as a creative diversion while I work on XMASDM2 and Netherworld. 
			  Secondly, its purpose is to reacquaint me with my unique, dark TNT-style 
			  editing. Lastly, and most importantly, it offers an additional episode 
			  of TNT to entertain you during the development period of TNT4. 

Additional Info		: Once again, this creation is characterized by a brown, Quake-like,  
			  and dark theme. If you didn't enjoy TNT1-3, it's likely that this  
			  one won't appeal to you either, as you may find it similarly  
			  displeasing. A unique aspect of this work is my attempt to blend  
			  the style of TNT3 with that of TNT1. Let's find out if I've managed  
			  to successfully achieve this fusion.

Special Gameplay Hints	: The key concept here is "Monster Infighting." You won't have sufficient   
			  ammunition to eliminate all the monsters on your own. However, if you   
			  can strategize and cause the monsters to battle each other, you might   
			  just succeed in conquering this map. 

Story			: In this gripping narrative, set in a parallel timeline to the renowned marine's    
			  battle through the "Fortress of Damnation" in TNT3, the story unfolds with    
			  earth-shattering stakes.
   
			  The Earth's provisional government has uncovered a new portal to hell deep    
			  within the planet's asthenosphere. As you absorb this information, a sinking    
			  realization dawns on you: this mission may very well be a one-way journey,    
			  severing the ties with your friends, your family, and your beloved wife forever.    
			  But lingering farewells would only amplify the agony, an agony that's    
			  already unbearable. With resolve steeling your heart, you step into your    
			  living room, shouldering two bags. You pick up two cigars â€“ a small solace    
			  for the moments between your impending triumph... or death. Leaving your house,    
			  you board the government's black hovercraft, embarking on a journey of no return.
   
			  Five days later, you find yourself on an isolated island, surrounded by an    
			  endless sea of lava. Your specialized marine suit shields you from the extreme    
			  pressure and scorching temperatures of this hellish landscape. The vehicle    
			  that transported you to the heart of the Earth has departed, leaving you    
			  alone in this inferno. Now, the fate of our planet rests in your hands. You    
			  are Earth's last line of defense against the hellspawn, fighting not just for    
			  humanity, but for your family and friends, who will remain oblivious to the    
			  sacrifices you're about to make.
   
			  In this harrowing tale of valor and sacrifice, you embody the essence of a true    
			  hero, one whose deeds remain unsung and unknown, yet whose courage shapes the    
			  destiny of the world.
