Description             : This TNT Episode has three different aims. The first aim
			  is to give me alternation during my work on XMASDM2 and
			  Netherworld. The second aim is to get me back to my brown
			  and evil TNT-style editing and the 3rd and most important
			  aim is to provide you with one more episode of TNT to 
			  bridgeover the developement time of TNT4 ;)

Additional Info		: Once more, this is brown, quakish and dark. If you didn't like
			  TNT1-3, don't try this one because you will hate it. The only
			  special fact on this one is, that I tried to connect the TNT3
			  style again with my TNT1 style. Let's see if I succeeded :)

Special Gameplay Hints	: Just two words: "Monster Infighting", you won'T ever have enough
			  ammo to kill all the monsters, but if you get monsters to
			  fight each other, you will maybe beat this map ;)

Story			: The story takes place in about the same time when another
			  well-known marine fights his way through the "Fortress of
			  Damnation" in TNT3.
	
			  "Once more, earth's provisional government found a new gate
			  the hell in the planet's astenosphere. As you read the 
			  advice, you feel that this time, you won't ever see your
			  friends again, your family... your wife. But a long-goodbye
			  would make everything harder, harder then it is already.
			  You step into your living room, two bags over your shoulder,
			  take two of your cigars - just in case you have some time
			  left between your victory.. and death - and leave the house,
			  entering the black hovercraft of the government.

			  Just 5 days later, you are standing on a isle in a huge sea
			  of lava around you. Your special marine suit prevents you from the
			  high pressure and the unbelievable high temperature around you.
			  The landing machine with which you got that deep into earths
			  heart has already left you... it's now up to you to save
			  our planet from hellspawn, to save your family and your friends,
			  although they will never know it..."

			  "A true hero is the one whose exploits no one will ever discover!"

Technical Important Info: This map should run very smooth on every machine compared to
			  the 2,0GHz eating monster TNT3 Map01 :)

Special Thx goes to	: Enjay (once more :) for giving perfect support

			   problem (in some cases 10 seconds after starting
			   the topic ;) Thx alot Nigel!
