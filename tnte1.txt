* Original Description *

This is my submission for the NewDoom 'Wad in a Week' contest, titled 'Torment and Torture' 
due to its highly bloody content. Initially, I was hesitant to participate because I found 
the rules somewhat ambiguous. However, after seeking clarifications from Jason Sloan on 
certain aspects that were unclear to me, I started working on my level on Friday evening 
at 11 PM. I considered naming the level 'Wad on a Weekend,' but I decided against it. 
I hope you enjoy it!


* Original Story *

As you awaken, you find yourself in a dimly lit room without a ceiling. Just a few tubes 
prevent the red light from reaching the ground. In front of you stand two Hell Knights, 
who haven't yet noticed your presence. There's a Combat Shotgun lying on a small platform 
right before you. This is your opportunity—grab the shotgun and take down the demons.


* Original places, you must visit *

The Libraries: These are visually striking due to some elegant ornamental textures. However, 
exercise caution: behind each bookshelf, there might be an Arch-Vile ready to attack in just 
35 tics!

The Temple of Torture: This is an impressive temple. As you open its large portal, you are 
unaware that over 100 monsters are waiting for your arrival. Arm yourself with the Rocket 
Launcher and try to survive as long as you can. After defeating all the monsters, don’t 
forget to admire the exquisite mosaic ornaments on your left and right.

Before the Upper Libraries: Here you'll find a remarkable room-over-room effect.

The Tech Center: In this area, you activate a switch which opens the entrance to the Dungeons 
of Torment. The switch triggers an intricate ACS script that includes a bit of an earthquake,
 light fading, engaging text output, and of course, some DEMONS (including 1 Cyberdemon and 
20 Barons).

The Chaos Machine (Yellow Key): Upon entering this room, all is quiet. Suddenly, 
6 Masterminds and 4 Cyberdemons materialize! Your only escape is through one of the 
stairways leading upwards. As you ascend, 5 Imps emerge, but you quickly dispatch them with
 rockets. Upon encountering another switch, remember the demons are still waiting for you.
 Activating this switch causes a massive earthquake, a burst of light so bright that you 
can't see anything. The last thing you hear is the dying screams of the Cyberdemons and 
Spider Masterminds.

Before the Upper Libraries: Again, a nicely executed room-over-room effect.
