Description             : Prepare to descend into the abyss of "The City of The Damned 2," a haunting sequel to the unholy terror 
			  that was its predecessor. This nightmarish ZDoom map, infused with the sinister essence of Monolith's "Blood," 
			  now emerges from the depths, cloaked in the eerie glow of dynamic lights and adorned with nightmarish 
			  enhancements, all in the haunting embrace of GZDoom.

			  As you step into this accursed realm, brace yourself for a descent into madness. The very air is thick with dread, 
			  the city streets shrouded in perpetual darkness. Unholy forces conspire in the shadows, as malevolent zombies, deranged 
		  	  cultists, and diabolical demons lurk around every corner, their malevolence palpable. 

			  With trembling hands and pounding heart, you shall embark on a nightmarish odyssey where the line between the living 
			  and the damned blurs, and your very soul is at stake. Dare you enter this accursed city and confront the unspeakable 
			  horrors that await?
