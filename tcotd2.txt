Description             : The successor of "The City of The Damned", a ZDoom map
			  featuring resources from the Monolith game "Blood", this
			  time featuring dynamic lights and other nifty sourceport
			  additions in GZDoom. Expect a moody, dark and scary city
			  filled with zombies, cultists and evil demons.

Important Info		: If you get stuck while reading one of the messages
			  and notes lying around, use the defined key for
			  killing the message screen. Default is "K".

Weapon Info		: Some weapons have alternate fire that may help
			  you against special demons and enemies, so use'em!

GZDoom Settings		: Lightning Mode MUST be "Doom" style
			  Gamma Correction & Ambient Light
			   if the map is too dark with your monitor, simply adjust
			   the gamma settings or the ambient light level settings.
			   It's impossible to take care on every single person if
			   you only use light values below 100 so I fully leave
			   it up to, just make sure that it is not too bright ;)
