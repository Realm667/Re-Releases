* Description *

I just started to create this map as a demo level for my "Blood Resource Pack" but
as I began to work in the editor, I thought about releasing it and bringing it up to
final with some interesting other things included that I had just learned, as new enemies, 
new mp3, new gfx and other new stuff. So, this was produced only to test 
the new "DoomBuilder" and ZDoom 2.0 feature roll.
