This seems to be due to a special kind of poison transmitted by the creatures, and since the cultists have confiscated all supplies of antidotes from the hospital's stocks, our hands are tied. We can only palliate, no longer save anyone."

Now they've taken you away from me. While my love for you is limitless, I'm afraid my life blood is not. Alas, the Darkmoon thugs have bested me and all I can do now is sit here and bleed to death. I don't know if I will ever see you again..."

You will continue to roam the outlands, searching for a peace that never comes - for no matter where you may go, chaos will soon follow."
