NOTE_MANSIONNOTE,,Letter to Claire,
NOTE_TXT_MANSIONNOTE,,"My darling Claire,\n\nSorry I worried you earlier. Thank God I had my knife with me to scare it away, or I might not be here right now. It's really nothing to get upset about... just a bite. I'm sure the bleeding will stop soon for good, and then we can forget all about it.\n\nMartin's been making a lot of noise in his room today. He must be so hungry, it's been almost three days. I try talking to him through the door. I tell him we're sorry and that we both still love him, but it's like he isn't there anymore... it's like our son is gone, and there's something else in his place. He hit the door so hard I thought he was going to break out, but the lock has held out so far. The noises he makes... inhuman, like a wild animal. Claire, I'm growing so afraid of him I can barely stand to be in the house. Yet he is still our son, and I love him as I always have. I know you do too, darling, and I tell him so.\n\nWhat has become of this place? And what's become of us, that we keep our only child under lock and key? Sometimes I think we'd all be better off if we just went outside when the siren sounds... at least we'd be together at the end, as a family.\n\nOh ignore me. I'm just feeling a bit weak right now. I'll pop out later to get more dressing for the wound. I love you.\n\nYours forever,\nSteven",

I must stress that the rate of tissue decay appears to be faster than any case I can recall from my thirty-seven years in the medical profession.\n\nSevere tissue damage, contusion, and puncture wounds resembling an animal bite are evident on the subject's neck, around the area of the sternomastoid muscle.\n\nCase of death was massive organ failure. Preliminary reports suggest this was due to sepsis, however I have since noted high quantities of a previously unknown hemotoxin in the bloodstream.

He were real uneasy, kept looking over his shoulder and whispering. Said he knew of secret they're keeping... something to do with them creatures what come out at night. I thought he'd just had too much ale, but that night I heard a real racket outside - broken windows, screaming, men yelling. Not seen him or his missues since, and his kids have gone. I reckon them Cowls were behind it.\n\nMaybe he were robbed. He has all them diamonds and gold hidden in his house, everyone knows that. I still reckon it were Darkmoon though. I ain't hanging around to find out though, I'm catching the next train out of here. It's this Friday at eleven, you should meet me at the station and come with me. Be careful where you walk at night too. Jakyll were saying something about Darkmoon symbols and the siren...\n\nI'll tell you more when we're on that train.\n\nBartholomay",

Through the use of this rift, one may invoke the name of the arch-demon, Thamuz and summon it to appear in material form.\n\nThe power of the arch-demon holds sway over a host of lesser demons, whose very essence is in thrall to it. Thus the fate of the lesser demon is inextricably linked to that of the arch-demon:\n\n'Kill the puppet-master, and his puppets will fall control the puppet-master, and his puppets thou shall command.'\n\nSummoning the arch-demon is achieved through the use of three artifacts within the site of the dimensional rift:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Gaul's Sands of Time, held within an ancient hourglass retained by the Waybearers of the Pandemonium Shadow Show, servants of the arch-demon for generations\n\n- The skull of Thamuz, the last physical remains of the arch-demon's material form in our world\n\n- A diamond of pure and flawless quality to act as a conduit between the other two artifacts.\n\nThrough these artifacts, Thamuz may rise to appear in our world once more.",

We must act quickly.\n\nI have uncovered information that implicates the accursed Darkmoon cult in the horror that has befallen our city. In their desire for greater power over our people they have descended to meddling in the arcane and unholy arts, summoning demons and other abominations to terrorise and subdue us to their will. Yet their ambition outmatched their expertise, and they have now lost all control over their vile creations, which now infest our city in ever-greater numbers.\n\nThey will surely silence me for discovering these crimes. I urge you to meet me at once, that I may convey all my knowledge regarding their sins to you - that you may yet escape this darkest of places and expose their heresy to the highest laws of man.\n\nCome to my laboratory across town, I am secured behind the hidden door in the office.

NOTE_JAKYLL,,On Darkmoon and the siren,
NOTE_TXT_JAKYLL,,"09th November, 1916\n\nThings are getting worse here with every fearful night we survive. Marie and the girls haven't slept properly for days, and I have nothing of comfort to say to them. I myself lie awake at night, tormented not only by the fearful sound of the siren, but by the knowledge of what I have learned.\n\nDarkmoon... I always knew that they would bring evil and suffering to our land, but like everyone else I was powerless and afraid. Swiftly they slithered their way into our community, and in the blink of an eye the city was theirs, right up to the highest ranks of the Council. I remember a time when our city was a haven from tyranny and oppression. Now, though I still have material possessions and wealth, I live every second in fear.\n\nIt's at night, however, when the true terror comes. The siren... hearing it makes my blood freeze. I know now that Darkmoon are responsible. The blood of those that disappear in the horror of the night is on their hands, and theirs alone. I have to do what I can to end the nightmare, for we have been silent too long.\n\nI'm meeting Bartholomay in the tavern shortly. He is an uneducated fellow, but a trustworthy one, and I have known him many years. I will tell him all I know, in the hope that he will spread the truth of our suffering to those that may be able to free us.\n\nJakyll Warton",

NOTE_TXT_SURVIVOR,,"To the stranger that may read these words, I pray you take heed, for they are the words of a dead man.\n\nSince dawn I have hidden within these woods, without food or rest, praying for a ship that has never arrived. Now I know I am truly damned. Soon they will come for me, like they have come every night, devouring those left without shelter. I can still hear the screams of their victims... like their very souls had been torn apart. No-one escapes their grasp.\n\nThe city has become a festering mockery of its once-great self, consumed by evil and blasphemy. Unholy shapes roam the streets, strong beyond any human means. What weapons we had were useless without ammo, our supplies siezed by the Cowls and hidden, leaving us with nothing more than our fists and whatever tools we had to hand.\n\nOne by one we have fallen, til we were powerless to stop the slaughter. In my terror I fled, stabbing my way through the creatures so vile, flinging my pitchfork into their dark hearts... but I have merely delayed my fate.\n\nMy heart bursts with the thought of what has become of my friends and family... my Rosa... perhaps, by God's mercy, she is still alive, hidden from view in one of the secret places, or in a Moon Shelter... yet I know I am a fool to believe she survives\n\nThe siren is sounding... dear God, watch over my beloved Rosa. I long for the warmth of her arms to soothe this chilling darkness. And now, I commit my body to these black waters, for I would rather face eternal damnation than face the nightmares to come.\n\nStranger, turn and fly from this wretched place!",

NOTE_TXT_SPIDERQUEEN1,,"Those cursed Darkmoon heretics have won at every turn.\n\nIt all started when that sleazy Willard fellow moved into town. Said he was a singer. I'll have to admit, he does indeed have a nice voice. Sang regularly at the pub, made every girl in town head over heels for him. Never liked that sly face of his one bit. My girl, Alianna, said I was too insecure, too jealous. Was a man supposed to not say anything when he finds his fiancee spending an increasingly unhealthy amount of time at the pub?\n\nFollowed my instincts and decided to investigate the sleazeball one night. What I learned then was not meant for the faint of heart. I knew that man was trouble, but I didn't expect him to be a member of the Darkmoon cult! Those bastards are pure evil. Murder, abductions, demon worship... you name it. They've done it. I overheard their plan to capture as many women as possible to... the things they said they'd do to those women... my God, absolutely vile!\n\nNaturally, after telling Alianna about my findings, she dismissed me. We got into a quarrel, and as our misfortune would have it - Willard and several Darkmoon thugs broke our front door and forcefully took my Alianna away. Alas, my efforts to resist the brutes were in vain, for they have bested me. I now sit here as my life's blood continue to drain out of my body.\n\nTo the person who finds this letter... please find my beautiful Alianna... I dread to think of what those Godless Darkmoon heretics will do to her. Please... I beg of you...",

I should have listened to you... the wicked cultists have kept me locked in here without food and water for what seems like an eternity now.\n\nThey torture and violate me every single day, and after they're done with me, they would offer me a strange glowing vial and try to force me to drink it. As long as I refuse to drink it, they would continue to do as they please with me.\n\nI don't know how long I can take this anymore, Richter. Sometimes, Willard would come talk to me. He seems to know a lot about dark powers, and would tell me that my pain will end if just do as I'm told.\n\nRichter, I'm so hungry and thirsty... I'm alone, I'm afraid, and I'm broken... I miss you, Richter... I regret not listening to you...\n\nForever yours,\n\nAlianna",

Peace returns to the streets and alleys that were once swarming with vile sorcery. The wretched siren, that terrible harbinger of evil, will sound no more. The city is silent at last.\n\nBloodied and exhausted, you have witnessed more than enough slaughter for one night. Death seems to stalk you like a shadow, and here in this damned city he has made his presence surely felt. Slowly you pass through the city gates, and are soon vanished into the night. You will continue to roam the outlands, searching for a peace that never comes - for no matter where you may go, chaos will soon follow.\n\nAs for those of us left behind here... though the Arch-Demon may have fallen, the Darkmoon cult still survives. In time they will regain their strength and numbers, posed to cast a shroud of evil over the land one more. We can only pray for another lone hero, in the right place and time, to bring light to the darkness.\n\nFor us, the day of reckoning has merely been postponed.",
