Description             : The latest addition to the TNT series is here. Known for its 
			  immersive experience, you can expect to encounter a multitude  
			  of ZDoom effects, meticulously detailed areas, and, of course,  
			  engaging scripting. Additionally, numerous surprises are strategically  
			  placed throughout the map for an enhanced gaming experience. 

Additional Info		: For those who aren't fond of my signature brown style: it might  
			  be best to skip this map, especially if you're familiar with the  
			  "ikpack" texture set. This time, however, I've added some variety  
			  to the brown hues, and you'll also find areas with white and black  
			  color schemes. It's important to note that I've made a conscious  
			  effort to shift away from the Quake-like style of TNT2, aiming for a  
			  more classic Doom aesthetic. This change is intended to prevent the  
			  feeling of being lost in a modern 3D game. I hope you find that I've  
			  succeeded in this endeavor. 

Story			: Having battled valiantly through the formidable Ogro Steel Armory Grounds,   
			  you now stand at the icy peak of the mountain. Before you lies the   
			  treacherous path to the "Fortress of Damnation," the harbinger of doom,   
			  where the final hell portal, Earth's last bastion of terror, awaits.   
			  As tiny snowflakes drift from the heavens, your eyes pierce through the   
			  dense fog, revealing glimpses of a security structure. But hold your   
			  breath... there's movement... a groaning presence lurks within...

New Monster Info	: Soul Harvester - On the war-torn battlefields of Earth, the undead remnants 
					   of imps have endured, sustaining themselves by harvesting  
					   the souls of their vanquished victims. These tormented spirits  
					   now empower their hosts with formidable strength, all the  
					   while desperately seeking liberation from their agonizing  
					   existence. Aid them in their quest for freedom with your trusty  
					   Super Shotgun. But beware, these dark imps possess a might  
					   far greater than that of their ordinary brown counterparts.


			  Hell Warrior   - Do not underestimate these foes. While they might not possess  
					   the brute strength of a Baron of Hell, they are armed with robust  
					   titanium shields. These shields not only provide them with  
					   formidable protection but also have the unique ability to reflect  
					   your projectile weapons, including the BFG, Plasma, and Rocket.  
					   Additionally, these adversaries are capable of launching attacks  
					   with their shields, adding a complex layer to their combat strategy.

			  Enh. Cacodemon - Fresh from the infernal depths, meet the new cacodemons on the icy   
					   combat fields. These formidable foes have evolved to unleash three   
					   fireballs simultaneously in your direction. This impressive display   
					   of power, however, comes at a cost to their vital hellish energy,   
					   rendering them more vulnerable to your attacks. Despite this susceptibility,   
					   be warned: they remain a potent adversary, especially when they   
					   swarm in numbers greater than ever before.
			  
New Weapon Info		: Flame Bomb     - This weapon is a game-changer when wielded against a sizable group of demons,   
					   whether they be of lesser or greater might. Its bombs detonate with an    
					   expansive damage radius and a high rate of destruction. While not as    
					   perilous to the user as the rocket launcher, nor quite as powerful, it    
					   still stands as a formidable tool in your arsenal. Undoubtedly, you will    
					   find this weapon to be an invaluable ally in your battles.
