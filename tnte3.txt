Description             : The latest successor in the TNT series. As known, you
			  will encounter a lot of ZDoom effects, neat detailed areas
			  and of course scripting :) (not included are the many surprises
			  placed in the map :D

Additional Info		: For all of you guys who don't like my brown style: Don't play
			  this map in case you have ever taken a look at the "ikpack"
			  texture set. The only difference this time is, that the brown
			  colors vary and there are also some areas with white & black
			  color shemes ;)
			  Also, it is important that you know, that I have really tried
			  to change my quakish style of TNT2 back to a more doomish style
			  so you don't feel lost in one of those new 3D games. I hope I
			  succeeded ;)

Story			: After fighting your way trough the Ogro Steel Armory Grounds,
			  you find yourself on the icey peak of the mountain. Now, your
			  way leads straight ahead the "Fortress of Damnation" where you
			  will find the last hell portal, the last source of terror on
			  earth. Small snowflakes fall down the sky and you can see parts
			  of an security building through the thick fog... but wait...
			  someone's is moving there... groaning...

Technical Important Info: Some areas are high detailed and the map slowed a bit down
			  with 1024 x 786 at my Athlon XP 2100+ (256MB DDRAM) so if
			  you encounter performance problems, try a smaller resolution
			  or buy a new pc ;)

New Monster Info	: ||Soul Harvester|| - On the battlefields of earth, the undead
			  remains of some imps survived by gathering souls of their
			  blasted victims. Now, these tormented souls supply their host
			  with strong power and still try to escape their cruelly 
			  dwelling. Help'em by using ur Super Shotgun ;) Be careful, these
			  black imps are stronger then normal brown ones.
			  ||Hell Warrior|| - Don't unterestimate them. They may be not as
			  strong as a Baron of Hell but carry a strong titanium shield with
			  which they can protect theirselves and even reflect your projectile 
			  weapons (BFG, Plasma, Rocket). Also, they have the ability to 
			  shoot with their shield.
			  ||Enh. Cacodemon|| - Fresh meat directly from hell: The new 
			  cacodemons you will encounter at the icey combat fields
			  spit three fireballs at once at you. This performance
			  demands a lot of their vital hellpower and so on, they are
			  easier to be killed, though a strong opponent, more then
			  ever in swarms.
			  
			  Be sure to encounter a few other enemies ;) I just don't want to
			  tell you everything :)

New Weapon Info		: ||Flame Bomb|| - A very devastating weapon if you use it against
			  a larger group of inferior or superior demons. When the Bombs explode
			  they have a very large damage radius, a high damage rate but are not
			  as dangerous for you as the rocket launcher is (unfortunately also
			  not as strong as the rocket launcher), nevertheless, you will love
			  the weapon ;)

Thx goes to	        : Nick Baker for a few textures out of "Nightmare 1"
			  Perkristian for the hires Doom sound replacements
			  Ikka Keränen for the "IK Textures Pack"
			  Gothic Team for some "Gothic Textures"
			  Doomworld and ZDoom.Notgod forums for technical support 
			  as always :)
			  The "Hellstorm Team" because they gave me the idea of creating
			   a re-colored HellKnight with shield (check the "N'Garai
			   Daemonites" @ www.doomworld.com/hellstorm/monsters.html)
			  Randy Heit for ZDoom 2.0

Special Thx goes to	: Enjay for the "Snow Script" and not to forget for his
			   incredible good help with ZDoom 2.0 features, for his comment
			   on TNT2 and else!
